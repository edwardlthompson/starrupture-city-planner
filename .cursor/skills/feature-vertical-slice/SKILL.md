# Feature vertical slice

See also: `.cursor/commands/feature.md`, `docs/FEATURE_MODULES.md`, `docs/ux-ui-guidelines.md`

1. Execute **one** open BUILD_PLAN feature row only (logic, view, tests, i18n in one container).
2. Thin wiring in composition root (≤10 lines).
3. Views follow `docs/ux-ui-guidelines.md` (construction law) and `docs/DESIGN_GUIDE.md` (tokens/chrome). Empty, error, and loading in the same slice. One primary CTA. Gaps you cannot fix: append `UX-NNN` to the BUILD_PLAN UX inventory immediately.
4. After each AGENT step:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent-run.py watch-agent-gates --once --autofix --scope auto

```

On exit `2`, switch to Debug Mode or escalate. Do not batch multiple feature rows.

When the feature (or sprint) is all ✅: `python3 scripts/agent-run.py smoke-sprint --require` before the next feature.
