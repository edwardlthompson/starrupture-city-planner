# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Supported template version: see `.template-version` on `main`. Security fixes apply to the latest Release Please tag.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest| :x:                |
## Threat Model

See [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) and [`docs/PRIVACY.md`](docs/PRIVACY.md) for data-boundary expectations.

## Public defects (not vulnerabilities)

Use GitHub Issues: <https://github.com/edwardlthompson/agent-project-bootstrap/issues> — see [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md). That archive is searchable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Send a private report (GitHub keeps it non-public):

<https://github.com/edwardlthompson/agent-project-bootstrap/security/advisories/new>

That is **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**. If you cannot use GitHub, email the maintainers listed in `CODEOWNERS` with:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Acknowledgment | 3 business days |
| Initial assessment | 7 business days |
| Fix or mitigation plan | 30 days (severity-dependent) |
| Public disclosure | Coordinated with reporter |
## Security Practices

- Local audit before push: `python3 scripts/agent-run.py update-deps -- --audit` (npm/uv/`upd audit`; optional Trivy/OSV). GitHub Dependabot alerts remain the backup inbox; see [`docs/SECURITY_TRIAGE.md`](docs/SECURITY_TRIAGE.md)
- npm / uv / GitHub provenance: [`docs/PACKAGE_ATTESTATION.md`](docs/PACKAGE_ATTESTATION.md) (docs only; CI does not require registry attestations)
- Maintainer orchestrator: `bash scripts/run-maintainer-gates.sh` (weekly; full cycle omits `--quick`)
- Secrets must never be committed (Gitleaks pre-commit enforced)
- Report dependency vulnerabilities via local audit or Dependabot; do not commit patched forks without review
