## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Platform | Multi-stack template (Web, Python, Android, Node, optional Lightroom/Blender/Rust/Go) | 1.8.0 | Template maintainer repo |
| License | MIT | - | Pure FOSS |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases + GitHub Pages demo | - | F-Droid/Winget stubs for child repos |
## Active Modules

- ✅ Web / PWA (`modules/web/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Python (`modules/python/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Android / F-Droid (`modules/android/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Node API (`modules/node/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Lightroom Classic (`modules/lightroom/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Rust (`modules/rust/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Go (`modules/go/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Blender icon factory (`modules/blender/MODULE.md`)

## Threat Model Checklist

- ✅ `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` drafted (STRIDE, trust boundaries, top abuse cases, OWASP LLM Top 10 walk)
- ✅ No proprietary closed-source SDKs in production path
- ✅ Opt-in only telemetry (GDPR/CCPA compliant); see `docs/PRIVACY.md`
- ✅ Secrets excluded from VCS (Gitleaks pre-commit)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning enabled (local `update-deps --audit` + CodeQL + Trivy + Dependabot backup)
- ✅ Input validation at all data boundaries
- ✅ `SECURITY.md` and private vulnerability reporting enabled

## Persistent Context

<!-- product-brief-sync:begin -->
_Template maintainer: no product AGENT.md. Children write AGENT.md before init._
<!-- product-brief-sync:end -->

### Project Purpose

FOSS coding-agent bootstrap template: labeled BUILD_PLAN sprints, Golden Path examples, CI guardrails, workspace memory, and design-system cohesion across Web and Android.

### Key Constraints

- Max 300 lines per static data file (UI + i18n), 150 lines per pure logic file
- Trunk-based development with Conventional Commits
- Strict type safety and test coverage budgets

### First-run agent

Cline is the first-run agent in Cursor: GitHub sign-in, FREE models, no API keys (no OPENAI_API_KEY and no Codex CLI on the first-time path). Codex remains optional advanced review only (`/codex-review`) and is not part of onboarding, `/tour`, `/prerelease`, or `/ship`.

Golden Path Settings/About/Feedback are a route stack, not three booleans. Web History API and Android BackHandler pop one level; at home Back stays in the app. Persist key `gp.nav.v1` restores location after theme/crash/share-target (web) and rotation/process death (Android). Home chrome is Settings-only; theme, About, and donate live in sectioned Settings/About menus with dropdowns. Ship UI to `docs/ux-ui-guidelines.md`; `/ux-review` uses the same law and writes `UX-NNN` inventory (not Sequential `/build` fuel).
