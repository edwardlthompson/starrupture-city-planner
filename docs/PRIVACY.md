# Privacy Policy (Draft)

> Customize for your application. Required when collecting any user data.

## Data We Collect

| Data | Purpose | Lawful Basis | Retention |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| App settings (theme, save-crashes toggle) | Feature functionality | Legitimate interest | Until the user clears app data |
| Crash / bug / feature report (opt-in, user-reviewed) | Debugging and product planning | Consent | GitHub issue retention; app keeps at most one pending crash |
## App update checks

- Release endpoint: GitHub Releases API (`/repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest`), once per 24 hours
- Not telemetry: User-Agent is product name and version only; no analytics identifiers
- Stored locally (device-only, not peer-synced): `last_check_at`, `last_seen_version`, `dismissed_version`
- Android Auto Backup excludes `gp_updates`; web uses `localStorage` (`gp.update.*`)
- Failed fetch, timeout, or unmatched installer assets stay silent
- Donate reminder is once per installed version after an update — not a daily nag

## Crash and feedback reports

- Filing requires a GitHub account (no email field in the app; no anonymous proxy on the default path)
- Payload may include: report kind, app version, OS family, exception type, sanitized stack, crash fingerprint, optional user text
- Payload must not include: email, name, user/device/advertising ids, IP, GPS, screenshots, logcat, cookies, tokens, `.env` values, or home-directory paths
- Capture is off by default. The user reviews sanitized markdown, then taps Open GitHub or Copy
- A self-hosted crash inbox (GlitchTip / Bugsink) is a child escape hatch only — do not enable without a DPIA. Stub: [`CRASH_INBOX.md`](CRASH_INBOX.md)
- Anonymous intake (GitHub App proxy) is a named follow-up — see [`CRASH_PROXY.md`](CRASH_PROXY.md) — and needs a new DPIA before enable

## Data We Do Not Collect

- **No GitHub Pages analytics** and **no default product telemetry** — the Pages demo and Golden Path apps ship without trackers (gate: `scripts/check-pages-analytics.sh`). Opt-in only if a child product adds an explicit consent path.
- No tracking without explicit opt-in
- No sale of personal data
- No PII in logs without user consent
- No install UUID “just for dedup”

## User Rights (GDPR / CCPA)

- **Access:** Users can request a copy of their data
- **Deletion:** Users can request data deletion
- **Opt-out:** Telemetry and analytics are opt-in only
- **Portability:** Export settings where technically feasible

## Data Minimization

- Collect only what each feature requires
- Use local-first storage where possible
- Anonymize or aggregate analytics data

## DPIA Checklist (`[HUMAN]`)

If processing EU personal data:

- 🔲 Document processing purpose and legal basis
- 🔲 Assess necessity and proportionality
- 🔲 Identify risks and mitigations
- 🔲 Record in `DECISION_LOG.md` or ADR
